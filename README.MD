# FROGGER 2 - SWAMPY'S REVENGE

1. Download OpenEmu Emulator from [here](https://openemu.org)
2. Download the files in this repository
3. In the left-navigation column, navigate to `Sony PlayStation`
4. Drag and drop the BIOS Files into the main view on the right.
5. Drag and drop the Game Files into the same view. [^1]


[^1] I keep getting an error, "Files failed to Import. No valid system detected: - Frogger 2 - Swampy's Revenge (USA).bin)", but after dismissing the alert, the game will load.
